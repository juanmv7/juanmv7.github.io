I am a Telecommunications Engineer based in Madrid, currently advancing my expertise through a dual master’s program in Machine Learning for Health and Telecommunications. With a strong foundation in AI and machine learning, I am passionate about exploring how these technologies can be applied across various industries to drive meaningful change. My studies have given me hands-on experience in developing intelligent systems for healthcare, a sector I believe holds immense potential for innovation through AI. I am especially excited by the prospect of using machine learning to tackle real-world challenges, where data-driven solutions can significantly impact people’s lives.

Alongside my focus on AI, I maintain a growing interest in integrated photonics, which combines my enthusiasm for physics with cutting-edge technology. While my primary goal is to deepen my skills in artificial intelligence, I find that photonics and its applications also inspire new perspectives and ideas in my work. I look forward to applying the insights and technical skills I am developing to impactful projects in the tech industry, where I hope to contribute to meaningful advancements across fields.
